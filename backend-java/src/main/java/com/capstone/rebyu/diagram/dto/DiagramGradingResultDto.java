/**
 * Deterministic (non-AI) diagram grading result. {@code status}:
 * GRADED (a real score was computed — may still be 0 for a blank/weak
 * submission), EMPTY_SUBMISSION (nothing meaningful was drawn — a
 * definitive, fair 0), or INVALID_REFERENCE (the admin's reference diagram
 * has no gradeable nodes — never penalize the learner for that; the caller
 * leaves the answer pending rather than fabricating a score).
 * {@code elementResults} DOES include the required (reference-side)
 * description and, when matched, what the learner actually drew — so a
 * learner can see exactly which required nodes/relationships were found or
 * missing. The caller is responsible for gating this behind the exam's
 * release-answers setting before it ever reaches a learner, the same way
 * MCQ answer keys are gated.
