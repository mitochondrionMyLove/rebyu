# Rebyu BKT FastAPI Backend

A complete Python backend for Rebyu's Bayesian Knowledge Tracing feature.

It combines:

- **FastAPI** for internal REST APIs and OpenAPI documentation.
- **PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Alembic** for BKT parameters, model runs, mastery, and event history.
- **pyBKT** for periodic parameter training and model-variant comparison.
- **Celery + Redis** for long-running training jobs and scheduled retraining.
- **Real-time Bayesian updates** for every learner answer.
- **Docker Compose** for local and server deployment.
- **Pytest** tests for the API, idempotency, fallback behavior, readiness, and BKT math.

## Architecture

```text

        |
        | POST one committed answer
        v
FastAPI BKT service ------ PostgreSQL
        |                       |
        | enqueue training      | parameters, mastery,
        v                       | runs, event history
      Redis                     |
        |                       |
        v                       |
 Celery worker ---- pyBKT ------+
        |
        v
 model.joblib + CSV/JSON/PNG artifacts
```

There are two distinct operations:

1. **Online mastery update** — runs immediately after an answer is saved. It uses the latest trained parameters and does not refit pyBKT.
2. **Offline training** — periodically compares six BKT variants, selects the best one using a learner holdout, saves the model, replaces current lesson parameters, and rebuilds mastery from historical responses.

## BKT design for Rebyu

| BKT concept | Rebyu source |
|---|---|
| Skill | `lesson_id` |
| Observation | `learner_exam_details.result` (`0` or `1`) |
| Guess/slip class | `EASY`, `AVERAGE`, or `HARD` |
| Learn/forget class | `DIAGNOSTIC`, `LESSON_QUIZ`, `MIDDLE_EXAM`, or `MOCK_EXAM` |
| Learner sequence | Ordered by `answered_at`, attempt, and exam-question record |

The trainer compares:

1. Simple BKT
2. BKT with forgetting
3. Difficulty-specific guess/slip
4. Difficulty-specific guess/slip with forgetting
5. Difficulty-specific guess/slip plus assessment-specific learning
6. Full Rebyu model: difficulty, assessment type, and forgetting

The selected model is based on validation AUC and RMSE using a learner-level holdout. Sparse lessons receive safe fallback parameters.

## Start with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Change SERVICE_API_KEY and production credentials in .env.
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

- FastAPI: `http://localhost:8000`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432`
- Redis: `localhost:6379`

The API container automatically runs:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Connect to the existing Rebyu assessment tables

After the main Rebyu database tables exist, run:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f sql/create_training_view.sql
```

The view expects these existing tables:

- `learner_exam_details`
- `exam_questions`
- `questions`
- `exams`
- `exam_types`

The SQL assumes the exam-type field is `exam_types.code`. Change it to `name` or `type_name` in `sql/create_training_view.sql` when your schema uses a different field.

The service only reads historical assessment records through `rebyu_bkt_training_data_v`. It writes only to the BKT tables created by Alembic.

## Train with the included demo CSV

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs/from-csv \
  -H "X-Service-Key: replace-with-a-long-random-internal-key" \
  -F "file=@sample_data/rebyu_bkt_demo_data.csv" \
  -F "requested_by=Glyzel" \
  -F "num_fits=1"
```

The response is a queued training run. Check it using:

```bash
curl -H "X-Service-Key: replace-with-a-long-random-internal-key" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs/RUN_ID
```

For production training from PostgreSQL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Service-Key: replace-with-a-long-random-internal-key" \
  -d '{
    "source_type": "database",
    "certification_id": 1,
    "requested_by": "admin:1",
    "num_fits": 5
  }'
```

Omit `certification_id` to train across all certifications.

## Update mastery after every answer

Call this endpoint only after the learner answer transaction has committed:

```http
POST /api/v1/bkt/mastery/events
X-Service-Key: <internal key>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "source_event_id": "learner-exam-detail:12:44:991:1",
  "learner_id": 12,
  "lesson_id": 101,
  "question_id": 501,
  "is_correct": true,
  "difficulty_level": "AVERAGE",
  "assessment_type": "LESSON_QUIZ",
  "occurred_at": "2026-07-12T12:00:00+08:00"
}
```

`source_event_id` must be stable and unique. A recommended value is:

```text
learner-exam-detail:{learner_id}:{exam_id}:{exam_question_id}:{attempt_no}
```

Sending the same event again returns `"duplicate": true` and does not increment mastery or attempt count twice.

`examples/rebyu_assessment_hook.py` contains a Python/httpx integration function.

For strong delivery guarantees, use an **outbox table** in the main assessment backend: save the answer and outbox record in one transaction, then let a worker retry delivery to this API. Idempotency makes retries safe.

## Important endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/health/live` | Process health |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/health/ready` | Database readiness |
| POST | `/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs` | Train from the Rebyu database view |
| POST | `/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs/from-csv` | Train from an uploaded CSV |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs` | List model runs |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs/{run_id}` | Read training status and metrics |
| POST | `/api/v1/bkt/training/jobs/{run_id}/cancel` | Cancel a queued job |
| POST | `/api/v1/bkt/mastery/events` | Process one answer |
| POST | `/api/v1/bkt/mastery/events/batch` | Process up to 500 answers |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/mastery/learners/{learner_id}` | All lesson mastery for a learner |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/mastery/learners/{learner_id}/lessons/{lesson_id}` | One mastery record |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/bkt/mastery/learners/{learner_id}/lessons/{lesson_id}` | Reset mastery |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/models/active` | Active trained model artifact |
| GET | `/api/v1/bkt/models/lessons/{lesson_id}/parameters` | Aggregate and class-specific parameters |
| POST | `/api/v1/bkt/analytics/readiness` | Weighted readiness score |

All BKT endpoints support `X-Service-Key`. The check is disabled only when `SERVICE_API_KEY` is empty, which should be limited to local development.

## Mastery levels

| Probability | Level |
|---|---|
| Below `0.40` | `weak` |
| `0.40` to below `0.70` | `developing` |
| `0.70` to below `0.85` | `good` |
| `0.85` and above | `mastered` |

Thresholds are configurable in `.env`.

## Readiness score

The readiness endpoint combines available components and renormalizes their weights when a score is missing.

Default weights:

| Component | Weight |
|---|---:|
| Average BKT lesson mastery | 60% |
| Diagnostic | 5% |
| Lesson quizzes | 15% |
| Middle exams | 10% |
| Mock exam | 10% |

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/bkt/analytics/readiness \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Service-Key: replace-with-a-long-random-internal-key" \
  -d '{
    "learner_id": 12,
    "lesson_ids": [101, 102, 103, 104],
    "diagnostic_score": 62,
    "lesson_quiz_score": 78,
    "middle_exam_score": 74,
    "mock_exam_score": 71
  }'
```

## Scheduled retraining

Celery Beat queues a database training run every Sunday at **2:00 AM Asia/Manila** by default. Configure it with:

```env
SCHEDULED_RETRAINING_ENABLED=true
SCHEDULED_RETRAINING_DAY_OF_WEEK=sun
SCHEDULED_RETRAINING_HOUR=2
SCHEDULED_RETRAINING_MINUTE=0
```

The scheduled task skips execution when another training run is already queued or running.

## Generated training artifacts

Each run receives its own directory under `ARTIFACT_DIR/<model_run_id>/`:

- `rebyu_bkt_model.joblib`
- `model_comparison.csv`
- `skill_data_quality.csv`
- `bkt_parameter_classes.csv`
- `bkt_parameters.csv`
- `bkt_parameters.json`
- `bkt_predictions.csv`
- `learner_lesson_mastery.csv`
- `bkt_model_run.json`
- cleaned training CSV
- model comparison chart
- mastery distribution chart

The database stores the active artifact path and SHA-256 checksum.

## Run without Docker

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Start the worker and scheduler in separate terminals:

```bash
celery -A app.workers.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=1
celery -A app.workers.celery_app.celery_app beat --loglevel=INFO
```

For a local demonstration without Redis:

```env
CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=true
```

Then run:

```bash
python scripts/train_demo.py
```

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

The completed package currently passes eight tests. The pyBKT smoke test also completes against the bundled 2,304-row dataset and selects the `full_rebyu` candidate.

## Production notes

- Keep the BKT service on an internal network and set a strong `SERVICE_API_KEY`.
- Use one Celery training worker initially. pyBKT fitting is CPU intensive, so avoid running many fits concurrently on the API host.
- Mount `ARTIFACT_DIR` on persistent storage or replace local artifact storage with S3.
- Back up the BKT tables together with the Rebyu assessment database.
- Increase `BKT_NUM_FITS` to `5` or `10` only after measuring worker runtime.
- Train only after enough new responses are available. Real-time answer processing should update mastery, not retrain the model.
- Never use test-set performance as training input. The included pipeline holds out entire learners to reduce leakage.
